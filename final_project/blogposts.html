            <p>December 3, 2021</p>
            <p>
              I have been living with a spouce with depression for 9 years. This
              has not been an easy road for anyone. It is hard to watch someone
              you love suffer and not be able to help. There were times, many
              times, when I was trying to help but did just the opposite. I was
              soon the only one he felt he could talk to but I also had a very
              hard time hearing how he was feeling. He tried many different
              avenues to feel better (doctors, prescriptions, therapists,
              therapy practices, meditation, etc) to no avail. Again, so hard to
              watch when he was trying as best he could and still received no
              help or relief. He never gave up though. He kept getting up
              everyday and trying his best. Though some days are better than
              others, he has learned how to keep going and living with
              depression. Sometimes it is hard to remember (especially on the
              low days) how much of a hero my husband is to me. While depression
              is hard for everyone involved, hardest for the one suffering from
              depression, through faith, love, and long-suffering all involved
              can keep going. To those still struggling, please don't give up.
              You are needed and loved!
