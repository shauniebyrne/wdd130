          themselves just trying to get through day-by-day. They are trying to
          cope with having depression and anxiety. However, they do not want to
          have the stigma that comes with seeking professional help. They do not
          want the solution to be pills. The process of trying to find the right
          prescription and then the right dose can take up a lot of precious
          time. Time they might not have. Do you find yourself in this situation? This site             offers another solution. This site is specifically for people that are trying to               find information and learn or to find a community and be inspired by others
          that are going through what you are going through. Here, you will find
          answered questions that individuals may have from being undiagnosed. At first, the             focus will be mainly on depression and anxiety but will branch out as there is need.          </p>
