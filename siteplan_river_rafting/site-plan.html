      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to advertise for the company on a global level.

This website will also help us compete with our competition and be a great advertising tool.  We need to supply important information about our company, such as: contact information, all about us information,white water rafting tour information, and the ability to book tours online. Having a website for our company will allow us to compete on the social medial level.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience for our company will be everyone that wants to have the experience of white water rafting. So, we are targeting the young to the elderly and need to make a website that will catch all ages eye.  We will have different tours of different lengths and difficulty for different situations.  Families with young children and elderly will have slower rivers.  Families with middle to older aged children, individuals, or groups can choose between moderate and difficult rivers based on their experience and adventure level.  There will also be shorter (day) tours or longer (overnight) tours, so individuals and families in all financial situtations will be able to go white water rafting.  Since our audience for the website will be everyone, we need to have this website be accessable through all avenues; be it: desktop computer, laptop, or mobile phones.</p>

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Archivo Black
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this font because I wanted my heading font to be bold so it would stand out more and be bolder (darker and thicker) than my paragraph font. I also wanted a font that was a little bit more spaced apart so that it would be easier to read for all levels of readers.  Lastly, I chose this font for the header after I had picked my paragraph font and felt that this was different enough that they didn't look the same but close enough to match well with each other.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Balsamiq Sans
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this font to be my paragraph font because I really liked the shape of the letters. It is fun enough and spaced apart enough to be an easy read for kids but also professional looking. I think it really catches the eye and also is an easier font to read. This is important because I want people to want to read our website and also want all ages to be able to read it.  
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado. White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it soundsâ€¦it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
     
      <h4>
        About Our Rivers Wireframe
      </h4>
      <p>
        Slight change from the Wireframe plan, there will be no "Book Now" buttons on these pictures because they are going to be placed on the Rates/Dates pictures.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Rates/Dates Wireframe
      </h4>
      <p>
        Slight change from the Wireframe plan, there will be another section added at the bottom before the footer that will contain additional information about the trips.
