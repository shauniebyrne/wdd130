      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Have you ever felt misunderstood? Have you ever sought help and still
        felt lost? Do you need a place to go to find hope? That is the purpose
        of this website. Not to get gain or to sell anything but to be a place
        of information. To be a place where anyone can go for ideas on how to
        improve their life. This website is meant to provide a sense of
        community and resources that can help everyone live a life they can be
        physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually happy living.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The target audience for this website is mainly for people looking for
        help concerning their health. So many suffer with diseases like anxiety
        and depression and go to a doctor for help only to have nothing solved.
        This site is also going to be for those looking for answers that haven't
        sought professional advice. This site, however, will not be a place for
        people to go to be diagnosed, rather it is a site for our audience to be
        able to come to and find help regardless of where they are on their
        personal health journey.
      </p>

        Typography
      </h3>

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Fira Sans (google font), Georgia, serif
      </h4>
      <p>
        Picked this font because it is more bold, susinct, clear, and takes up a
        bit more space. This is also a calming and simplistic font which is the
        end goal for this site. Felt it was important to pick a font that was a
        little more bold than the paragraph so the heading would stand out a
        bit. Also, picked two fonts (for the heading and paragraphs) that are
        similar so as not to distract from the information on the site.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Ubuntu (google font), Trebuchet MS, sans-serif
      </h4>
      <p>
        Wanted to keep the paragraph font simple and easy to read. The idea is
        to have a calming affect and felt this font would do this best. Want the
        audience to be able to read what is in the paragraphs quickly and easily
        without really having to concentrate hard (which would have to be done
        with a hard to read font).
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
        offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
        Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
        Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
        physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
        adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it
        happen for you.

          What to Expect: Too many individuals this day and age find
          themselves just trying to get through day-by-day. They are trying to
          cope with having depression and anxiety. However, they do not want to
          have the stigma that comes with seeking professional help. They do not
          want the solution to be pills. The process of trying to find the right
          prescription and then the right dose can take up a lot of precious
          time. Time they might not have. This site offers another solution.
          This site is specifically for people that are trying to find
          information and learn or to find a community and be inspired by others
          that are going through what they are going through. The site will
          answer questions that individuals may have from being undiagnosed. It
          will focus mainly on depression and anxiety and branch out as there is
          need.
        </li>
        <li>
          Specifics: The site will give visitors the
          opportunity to find information that can inspire them. It will also
          give them an opportunity to join a community via a mailing list that
          will connect them to others around the world that are dealing with
          what they are. Lastly, this site will give visitors an opportunity to
          fill out a form that will allow them to comment on our site that will
          be posted right on the website.
        </li>
        <li>
          Why Use This Webpage Over Others: Visitors will come to this site and
          not others because it not only will provide them with information but
          also a community where they can learn from others going through what
          they are on a personal level. It is specifically designed for people
          that are not diagnosed and do not want to find a solution to their
          suffering via medicine. The home page will provide the information and
          a brief overview of the purpose of the site. Hopefully directing any
          site visitors to the page(s) of most relevance for them.

      <h4>
        Depression/Anxiety
      </h4>
      <p>
        Information Available:The site will offer visitors
          information about depression and anxiety. This information will come
          from credible sources and will include symptoms and solutions to
          coping with depression and anxiety through non-medical mechanisms.
          Specifically, the mechanisms will focus on enhancing their physical,
          mental, emotional, and spiritual health. This site will also provide
          the visitor with podcasts that they can listen to instead of read if
          they find they donâ€™t have the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will add information to this as the site develops.

        guests around topical [natural] ways to increase your physical,
        emotional, mental and spiritual resilience.

        towards developing their own resilience. In addition to gaining access
        to meaningful [readable] content, including some special posts developed

        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
        here
      </p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>
        There will be more subjects than Depression and Anxiety, this is just what we are starting with at the moment. The rest will come with time and are not shown on the wireframe as a result.

      <h3>Podcasts</h3>
      <p>
        More podcasts can be added than what is in the wireframe. The idea of back and forth with picture and description will continue.
