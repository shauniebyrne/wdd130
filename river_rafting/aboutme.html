        My husband (Jared) and I have been married for 17 years. We have been
        blessed with four kids. A daughter (aged 16), and three boys (aged 15,
        12, and 9). They keep us young and on our toes!</p>
      <p>
        I have many hobbies. I love to: sing and listen to music (I always have
        music of all genres playing in the background), read, bake, scrapbook,
        play boardgames and Mario/Lego Switch games, watch movies, go boating
        and cliff jumping, texting friends, and (most importantly) hanging out
        with my family.</p>
      <p>
        I am currently a stay at home mom pursuing a higher education. I got my
        Degree in Administrative Assistance but that was 17 years ago. I was
        directed to go back to school. I finished the Pathway Connect Program
        and loved it and am now looking to get a BS by pursuing three
        certificates; Coding and Web Design, CADD, and Graphic Design. I have
        decided to follow this career path because I can work from home while
        still having the freedom to be home when my kids and grandkids are.
        Also, because all of those certificate topics facinate me. My husband is
        very excited for when I graduate so I can fulfill all his grand plans
        with starting businesses.</p>
      <p>
        I feel very blessed to have been able to be a member all my life. One of
        my favourite quotes is by Elder Russell M. Nelson: Men are that they
        might have joy - not guilt trips!</p>
